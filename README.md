# Prime-Numbers-Spiral
A Prime Number Spiral Simulator

Each point coords is based on the base coordenate and its number (the distance) + its number again, but in radius. I made it with inicial, with only Prime numbers, that forms that strange pattern, but you can try use diferent numbers, like 1 - 10000.

I have plans to make it more user friendly, but don't expect me to work on it regularly.

here are some videos/posts that i based on
